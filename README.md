# Lab 6 - Buttons And RGB LEDs
In this lab, we will focus on turning on an RGB LED using a button

## Goals & To Turn In
### Goals
- Run Ardunio without computer
- Understand the point of a resistor
- Use a button, with power, without sending signal to the Arduino

### To Turn In
Make a folder for lab 6 in your google drive folder.
Add document for written responses and links to photos or videos.
Submit any arduino code as a zip file. 

1. Link to video of Ardunio running last week's code on wall power, not through a USB hooked up to the computer
2. 
- Why do we use resistors in circuits? 
- Do they do anything special to the amount of light running through a circuit? 
- What is the color scheme for a 330 ohm resistor?
- picture of led code from last week working in your circuit with a resistor
3. Press the button and turn on your normal LED
- Drawing of circuit for button. Does not need to be an electrical drawing. Can be an electrical drawing. 
- Video of button press circuit
4. Design your lantern. Make a plan. Draw it, put the picture into the lab. Write about it. 
5. (NEXT WEEK) Circuit trigger for code with button
6. (NEXT WEEK) Use an RGB LED. (May be extra - let's see if we get it working)
